## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning Python and diving deeper into software development.
Iâ€™m passionate about creating web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and always looking for ways to improve my skills. 
Fun fact: I love solving coding challenges and learning new things every dayâ€”it's like a puzzle waiting to be solved! 
Iâ€™m open to collaborating on open-source projects and sharing knowledge with others
